-------------
- api-fetch-data-with-pagination.php fetches data from JSON API and applies pagination to it
- date-comparison-with-duration.php takes input of two date (old date as Database date and Current date) and also the hours and minutes. And then it checks if the date and time is expired or not. Very simple procedural approach. Example case could be: If you have date in format like- 'dd/mm/yyyy' and hours and minute 'hh:mm' and duration '1' hour. So, you set a course to be start in 03/04/2018 when the time is '10.30' and will be active for 1 hour. That's all. This codebase does the calculation.
- jquery-table-add-remove.html very simple jquery approach to add table row data and delete them, and do the calculation or price input.
